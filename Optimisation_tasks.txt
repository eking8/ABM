Optimize form_fam_group function: 
- Reduce the time taken by checking and setting self.checked in line 190. 
- Improve the decision logic for setting self.travelswithfam under different conditions to minimize repetitive checks.

Refactor define_groups function:
- Optimize the list comprehension in line 205 and the sorting in line 206 to improve efficiency.
- Address the excessive time taken in member.joingroup(all_agents) in line 239 which consumes 99.8% of the time.

Optimize joingroup function:
- Reduce the overhead caused by the list comprehension in lines 254-255, which is very costly in terms of performance. 
- Consider optimizing how self.group and self.ingroup are updated throughout the function.

Refactor group_speeds_and_cap function:
- Improve the computation of self.speed using a more efficient method than min in a list comprehension (line 298).

Address performance in generate_random_age: 
- Optimize the loop through the age distribution (line 312-314) which can be simplified or vectorized for better performance.

Reduce complexity in assess_situation_and_move_if_needed:
- This function is extremely lengthy and handles multiple responsibilities. 
- Consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused functions. 
- Lines 447 and 448, involving pathfinding across the graph, need serious optimization due to their high computational cost.

Improve merge_nogo_lists function: 
- The large amount of time taken to handle local agents (line 484) suggests a need for more efficient data handling or querying methods.

Evaluate and refactor roulette_select: 
- Optimize the scoring logic in lines 556-557, which currently runs very slow.

+++++++

Improve handling of nodes and paths in camp_paths: 
- The function camp_paths in line 642 takes significant time, indicating that the pathfinding or graph traversal logic might need optimisation.

General Code Clean-up: 
- Review and remove or replace any deprecated or inefficient methods. 
- Ensure consistency in style and comments for better maintainability. 
- Add or improve error handling and input validation across all functions to enhance robustness.

Enhance find_nearest_cities_with_airport and find_shortest_paths_to_neighboring_countries:
- These functions appear to have significant computational overhead, particularly when calculating paths and filtering based on conditions (e.g., border closures). 
- Consider optimizing the filtering logic and exploring more efficient graph traversal techniques.

Optimize the use of random selections and conditions:
- Functions that use random choices or extensive condition checks (such as in the joingroup and define_groups functions) might be optimized by rethinking the logic or data structures used to reduce complexity and execution time.

Revise data structures for performance gains:
- Evaluate the data structures used, especially in intensive operations like graph manipulations and updates. 
- Using more appropriate data structures (e.g., sets for membership checks or priority queues for pathfinding) could enhance performance.

Implement caching where appropriate:
- For functions that perform expensive computations that might be repeated with the same inputs, consider implementing caching mechanisms (e.g., using functools.lru_cache) to store results of expensive function calls.

Parallelize computationally intensive tasks:
- For functions like assess_situation_and_move_if_needed, which handle large amounts of data and complex calculations, consider parallel processing techniques to distribute the workload and improve execution speed.

Refactor for modularity and readability:
- Break down large, complex functions into smaller, more manageable functions. 
- This not only improves readability but also makes the code easier to maintain and test.

Increase unit tests and integration tests:
- Given the complexity and the various functionalities, increasing the coverage of unit tests and integration tests would help ensure that changes do not introduce new bugs and that all parts of the application interact correctly.

Profile memory usage:
- Apart from CPU profiling, consider performing memory profiling to identify and optimize high memory usage parts of your application, which can indirectly improve performance by reducing paging and swapping.

Documentation and Code Reviews:
- Ensure that all functions and complex logic are well-documented with comments explaining the "why" behind certain decisions, which is crucial for future maintenance. 
- Regular code reviews can also help identify potential inefficiencies or bugs that automated tools might miss.

Continuous Performance Monitoring:
- Set up a system for continuous performance monitoring, especially for critical sections that heavily impact overall performance. 
- This can help catch performance regressions and ensure that the application scales well with increased load or data volume.
